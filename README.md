# SemesterProject-Haakon

# interaction-design-ca-report
To start off i linked my semesterproject website (Community Online Museum) to hotjar, and sent the link to a friend and family. After viewing a quick session on the website, i got some feedback on what the person thought. 

Instantly the person testing the website told me the logo was not clickable, which was weird for him. So i added it to my list. Also when i watched him use the website i spotted that i had linked a couple of things wrong, i was actually missing a whole page (get involved page).. So that was quickly added to my list. I didn't have a lot of time with the person so i moved on to someone else.

The next person i decided to ask a few questions and not use hotjar. First off i asked if there was something irregular on the homepage? The person said the same thing about the logo. Also the person clicked the "for kids button" and entered the explore page, after i asked if there was something they thought was missing, they told me they would want the page to automatically scroll down to the for kids section and for teachers section etc. So i added this to my list.

After i gathered all of this information i fixed the things that people told me would improve the website. Personally i thought they were right, the website was more enjoyable and smoother to use after the improvements.

Also i made a responding contact form, i decided to use the advanced contact form from previous course assignment as inspiration.

Finally to sum up the assignment. I had a very busy week and didn't manage my time great, so i am not really happy with my effort, but in my spare time i will continue to work with the things i did not do this time. I planned on making a ticket page, but did not do it this time.. 

# CMS-ca-report

First off i tried to make my wordpress connected to localhost and flywheel, which was not as easy as i thought in the beginning, but after a while i made it work. Decided to go for flywheel host.

After i made sure everything was all right with headless cms i started to make some blog posts, i only made 5, because i couldn't be bothered making more at the time..

So now it was time to fetch API's for ''product page'' and detailed page, i used what i learned from previous javascript CA and made it work. For the styling i decided to keep it ''small'' and kind of looking like a product page would, just because i wanted to make sure i practiced this style of execution. 

The details page i kept very clean and simple, i didn't really feel the need to style much in there as my museum page is quite simple and clean already.

To finish off i made sure everything was working on netlify, it didn't work in the beginning, but eventually i made it work. Not quite sure how, but i changed http to https and did a couple other things and it worked in the end.
